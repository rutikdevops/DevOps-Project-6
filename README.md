<br></br>


# 1. Install and Configure the Docker on all the instances :-
```bash
ubuntu
sudo su
apt update -y
apt install docker.io -y
docker --version
systemctl enable docker
systemctl start docker
systemctl status docker
```
<br></br>


# 3. Initialize Swarm on Swarm Master Instance :-
- Access the "Swarm Manager" node and initiate the Swarm by running the following command:-
```bash
docker swarm init     # This command initializes an empty Swarm.
```

# 4. Add Workers to the Swarm :-
- After initializing the Swarm on the "swarm-master" node, a key will be generated. You need to copy and run this key on the other server (Swarm-worker). This step adds both machines as workers to the Swarm.

# 5 : Check Swarm Node Status :-
- To verify the status of all nodes in the Swarm, run the following command on the manager node:
```bash
docker node ls       # This command will display information about all the nodes in the Swarm.
```

# 2. Clone the Github code on Master :-
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LondheShubham153/two-tier-flask-app.git
cd two-tier-flask-app
```
- Create Docker File :-
```bash
Vi Dockerfile1.dev
```

# Create a docker image from Dockerfile :-
```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile1.dev -t reactapp1 .
docker images
```

# Create Docker Container from Docker Image :-
```bash
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 --name reactApp reactapp1
```
- Now, The React App is Running :-



# 6: Create a Docker Service üõ†Ô∏è
- On the Swarm Manager node, create a Docker service using the following command:
```bash
docker service create --name react-app-service --replicas=2 --publish 3000:3000 rutikdevops/reactapp1
```
- This command creates a service named "react-app-service" with three replicas, publishing port 3000.

# 7: List Docker Services :-
- To list the Docker services running in the Swarm, use the following command:-
```bash
sudo docker service ls     # This will display a list of services, including the one you just created.
```

# Step 8: Verify Containers :-
- The service you created will deploy containers on the Master and worker nodes. To check if containers are running on the master node, execute:
```bash
docker ps                 # You should see containers related to your service.
```

# 9: Access the Web App üåê :-
- Now, your web app service is running on all three nodes. To access it, grab the IP address of any of the nodes followed by port 3000, like this:
```bash
ec2-3-111-170-216.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:3000
```

- You should be able to access your web application through this URL.



# Push Docker Image to DockerHub :-
```bash
docker login
# Enter username & password
docker tag reactapp1 rutikdevops/reactapp1
docker images
docker push rutikdevops/reactapp1
```

# Guest User pull this Docker image And deploy it on his own Machine :-
```bash
docker pull rutikdevops/reactapp1
docker images
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 --name rutik_reactapp rutikdevops/reactapp1
```
